# Set Up üî¢

1. To download all the Python library dependencies, use 1pip install -r requirements.txt1 in your terminal.
2. Change the CSV data as you wish, and edit the code as necessary to update the dataframe to access columns by names. (Line 15 and 16)
3. Update titles and label names. 
4. Run `graph.py`. If you'd like the animation to be faster, you cane edit `anim = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, interval=150, frames=100, repeat=False)` to have a shorter interval time.
